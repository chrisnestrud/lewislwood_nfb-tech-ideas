# NFB cs Technical Ideas for Conventions

You can read the details at this [site.](https://lewislwood.github.io/nfb-tech-ideas/)

There is always room for improvement and ways to innovate as well. This includes conventions (State or National).

This is the holy grail of all that people seek in making life equitable for blind and sighted alike. Some techniques or technologies we may develop can be useful in work or education environments as well.  We cannot expect corporations to adapt, if we are not willing to try and demonstrate our latest adaptive approach. Then they will see in practice and how knows they may have a gotcha moment as well.

This is in no way iron clad design or work on our parts. We are all quite busy and NFB has stated they do not wish to demand hours of free labor. NFB believes workers should be compensated for their works. So the purpose of the documents contained within are ideas and designes that can and should be reviewed by the NFB Technology people experts/employees. They can if they like present these ideas to NFB with implementation instructions and/or plans.

That being said. The documents may have some ideas for a grand future type implementation. As well as modest simple type plans. Some may be quick and easy to implement, while others may take years to fully be realized.


*** Documentation Notes

This matter and idea was brought up at the NFB Computer Science Meeting2023 by Lewis Wood.  I am preliminarily setting up this repo on my github.com. Now if at a later date NFB CS creates an Organizational Repository Account I will transfer this repo over to them.  Please excuse any bad grammer. I am a developer and not a writer. Feel free for anyone to submit changes to this repo. Email me or create a repo issue.
