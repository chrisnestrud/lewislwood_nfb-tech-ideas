<h1>Exibit Hall Technology Ideas</h1>
<p>Problem I noted when entering the exhibit Hall was where iare things. What table is that over there? What section am I in? Where is the register? Where is the information table?</p>
<p>Short of having an AI assistant walking around with me, what could there be that would make it more efficient and less noise.</p>
<h2>Had to find the table and read the braill</h2>
<p>Many times someone was talking or in the middle of something. So getting to this braille can border on rude, so you end up waiting. Sure some kind of tile (low energy) could work, but that is costly counting the number of tables.</p>
<p>QrCodes could solve this.  While standing a few feet away simply scan a QrCode behind the table on the wall about 8 feet high. Then I get to know who they are  and their website.. Now I can decide to stand in line.  Since I am on their website I can also bookmark them.</p>
<h2>Sections / Areas</h2>
<p>QrCodes solve this Quite nicely.  Simply a free standing QrCode 8 feet high.  Would say &quot;Info desk this way, Marketplace behing , and Section C is directly in front of you.
