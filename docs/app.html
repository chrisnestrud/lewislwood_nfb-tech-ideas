<h1>Custom App</h1>
<p>Initially we should do a field study perhaps at state conventions or DC event.  Relying on the Operating system default behavior to process the QrCodes. Although they will need to turn on QrCode notification alert tone  and vibration as well.  Since your phone is up  in the air, you need to know when it locates a QrCode.</p>
<p>Next we will need a simple website that will render a page for the QrCode. Screen reader will hopefully start reading it immediately.</p>
<h2>Custom App features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Alert when scanned.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ignored prior scanned QrCodes and just play a short beep that detected and ignored.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Buffer QrCodes for event. Just in case no internet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Update buffered QrCodes if a data update detected.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ability to replay a QrCode and scroll through past QrCodes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Custom Device</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Small device with 2 ring loops. hold device to back of hand as scanner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Small display perhaps only 2-3 lines.</p>
</li>
<li><p>3 buttons</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chips, bluetooth, aux audio jack, wify card, (perhaps NFC), camera.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Very little memory needed . </p>
<ul>
<li>Price point perhaps $50- to $100.</li>
</ul>
<p>Scans QrCode and downloads all QrCodes for that event. Should not take much space.</p>
<p>Then non-technicals only need to get device and connect it at the registration table via a QrCode with WiFy passwords (may need to work out facillity agreement).</p>
