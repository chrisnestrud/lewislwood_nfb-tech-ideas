Initial Setup will require NodeJs.
If you already have NodeJs version 18  or higher skip thie next step.

Download and install NodeJs at the following address.
https://nodejs.dev/en/download


Once you have NodeJs you will need to do the following:

Command line is symbolized by a "$"

At root of repository folder you download or cloned.
$npm install
Now just be patient.  It will download neccessary packages and install them to prepare the project.


Now that Initial installation is complete you must run the compile step.

**********
Compile step.
$npm run compile
This recompiles the project and makes it ready to run.

As long as you only modify files in the md folder or the root folder *.txt and readme.md, and not add another md/*md file you will not ever need to run the compile step again.

***********
Build step.
This step converts the *.md files into *.thml and merges header and footer code to this html file.

$npm run build all

The above rebuilds all the html files in the docs folder.

You can rebuild select files.  Example:
$npm run build qrcodes
 
 The above only reprocesses the qrcodes.md and parses it into  docs/qrcodes.html

 To get a list of build options simply type build with not option.
 $npm run build
 returns a list of valid choices.

 ***********
 Adding a new *.md file or modifying anything under the src folder structure.

 If you add a new *.md, it will ot find it until you manually add it to the src/md-files.json .  Simply copy a object block of json and append the new md file settings.

 Now you must run the  compile step again. Then the build step and your new choice should be allowed and recognized.


**** Warning:  Header has multiple unclosed html tags on purpose.

<html>
<body>
<div class=".container">
<div role="main">

Those tags are closed in the footer which will be appended after the parsed markdown.

Small simple document modifying project, by techies and non-techies. I really enjoyed  writing this simple TypeScript app.

The cause is a good one. I hope something good comes from the ideas we come up with.


*****************
WARNING+++ This Repo does not sanitize the parsed markdown, thus malicious code can be incorporated.  You should always sanitize your resulting html, if taking input from untrested sources (such as public).  This repo allows anyone to submit changes, but only a limited trusted individuals will have the authority to incorporate those changes.

NPM has a number of snitizers (DOM, Pure, and more).
