#  How to edit or Submit edits

## Least technical method

Bottom of every page are download page links. You click on these links and you will be redirected to the github repo where the file will be displayed.  You will need to select copy page from the raw data page.  This is a markdown file for all pages. There are few exceptins (css, txt, ...). If your changes are small and quick.  Simply paste the text and description in the discussions of the repository on github. 

You may also submint submit your changes to a discussion forum nfbcs@nfbnet.org I or another volunteer will see about incorporating your changes.

##  Fork repo and issue pull requests

This option requires you to have a github account. You will want to fork the repo. Clone the repo locally where you can work on it locally and push it to your fork of the repo. Read the cloning repo instructions found at the root folder on how to rebuild the repo.

This is option requires you to have NodeJs installed, as well as Git installed. So that you can view the generated html files.
